Q:  How does ERES differ from a typical conference?
---
A:  The ERES meeting is explicitly designed for and by "emerging" researchers, including undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs.  We envision that the vast majority of the scientific talks will be given by postdocs and PhD students.  While most of the time will be devoted to scientific talks, the graduate students and postdocs that make up the organizing committee are also planning a few panel and lunch discussions on professional development topics, likely including proposal writing, career experiences and work-life balance.  (If you'd be interested in serving as a table discussion moderator, let us know at [L-ERES-2015-QUESTIONS@lists.psu.edu](mailto:L-ERES-2015-QUESTIONS@lists.psu.edu).

Q:  Will it is just be postdocs and PhD students?
---
A:  More senior researchers and undergraduate are be encouraged to participate, too.  We envision that the vast majority of the scientific talks will be given by postdocs and PhD students.  All participants who don't give a talk will be welcome to present a poster.  The organizers are planning a speed poster pitch session where poster presenters can give a 1 or 2 minute elevator pitch.  

Q:  Do you know how long the talks will be?
---
A:  Final decisions will be made once the organizing committee reviews the abstracts submitted.  Based on the large number of prospective participants expressing interest in giving a talk, we anticipate that most talks will be 15 minutes (to mimic AAS dissertation talks).

Q:  Are their preferred topics, or is that left completely free?
--- 
A:  The session topics will be chosen to reflect the abstracts submitted.  We're interpreting exoplanetary science broadly, so abstracts for related disciplines (e.g., brown dwarfs, protoplanetary disks, star formation, related instrumentation and theory) are encouraged.

Q:  Will the talks be arranged in sessions? Or will every talk be a stand alone?
---
A:  The talks will be arranged in sessions of related scientific topics.  However, we're not asking speakers to coordinate their talks.  

Q:  How many people are you expecting, or preparing for?
--- 
A:  We have reserved a venue that accommodates up to 150 people.  

Q: My question is not here in FAQ, what do I do now?
---
A: Email your question to [L-ERES-2015-QUESTIONS@lists.psu.edu](mailto:L-ERES-2015-QUESTIONS@lists.psu.edu), and we will get back to you promptly.
