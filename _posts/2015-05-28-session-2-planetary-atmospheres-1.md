Our first session of planetary atmosphere talks is chaired by PSU graduate student Natasha Batalha (who is also our live-tweeter for the symposium).

***Hubble Space Telescope Spectroscopy of WISE Detected Brown Dwarfs* (Adam C. Schneider, University of Toledo)**

The Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is an all-sky survey which is maps the sky in four infrared wavelengths, ranging from the near-visible to the mid/far infrared wavelengths. As such, WISE has been very very good at detecting very cool sources that appear bright in the infrared, like brown dwarfs. He's talking today mostly about Y dwarf stars, which are the coolest known brown dwarfs (but still aren't planets). Y dwarfs range from around 400 K to 250 K, which is near the temperature of Earth! Y dwarfs pop out in WISE images as bright green points, and we've found around 20 of them so far.

"Why WISE Ys?" These anchor our low-temperature spectroscopic models, places where "regular" stars don't emit a lot of light. Y dwarfs, because they are near the temperatures of planet can help us understand exoplanets, too. They are the "missing link" or the "crossover" objects. They are so faint that we can't really detect them using ground based telescopes, so we go to space with the *Hubble Space Telescope (HST)* and WISE.

They use *HST* to take spectra of their Y dwarf spectra in the Y-band (Why the Y-band of Wise Ys?) because as you get to lower and lower temperature, there is a very distinctive absorption feature in the ammonia band that appears in the Y-band. Their question is: as you go to lower temperatures, why does that absorption feature appear? Where does that ammonia go? Their answer is vertical mixing: the ammonia that would normally appear in the upper layers of the Y-dwarfs and cause that ammonia line are getting mixed into the lower layers, and so there is less ammonia than is expected. However, simultaneously fitting the near- and mid-infrared images is still an issue, as they want to fit all distinctive features at the same time. That issue is ongoing.

We're going to be changing gears and talking about how to write a successful fellowship or grant proposal with our Fellowship Panel, made up of four successful fellowship winners.
