Things are ramping up for the First Emerging Researchers in Exoplanet Science Symposium (May 28th & 29th). We have over ninety participants registered, and more than 70 abstracts submitted, so we are expecting an exciting and vibrant conference! If you didn't get your abstract submitted before the deadline, you can still submit a poster presentation, just visit the [abstract submission page](/abstract.html) before the final registration deadline of May 8th. We are hard at work on the final science program schedule and will post it soon. 

When planning your trip to State College, keep in mind that the group rates for both hotels expire on **April 27th**, so it is important to book your stay before then. We encourage attendees, especially those receiving travel grants, to find a roommate to share hotel rooms with. We have set up [room share matching form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16FJOdMI77jMmL2m83fRYPRy2DV4ir3fWwxBC0emscxA/viewform) on the [Travel](/travel.html) page to help you find a roommate.
