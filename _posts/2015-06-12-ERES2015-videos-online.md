The videos of the talks and panels we recorded have been added to our brand new [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl7kGXT4gcdHyclMvNQReZA/feed). We have also retroactively added the videos to the posts we live blogged during the meeting. 

And as a special bonus, here is a time lapse of Thursday's Poster Session!
