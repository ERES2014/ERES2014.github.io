A Poster Pop is a sixty second advertisement for a poster. You get one slide to supplement your presentation, and the goal is to attract people to your poster. Poster pops are a challenge, since you have to squeeze in your message in a short time. It's a good time to practice your "elevator pitch": describe your work to someone who doesn't already know what you're doing, and do it effectively in a short time (as if you only have the length of an elevator ride). The trick here is that you're not talking about everything that you're doing, but rather just on what your poster is presenting.
