Hi all! This is Kim Cartier, your ERES live-blogger for the conference. I will be posting summaries of talks and panel sessions as soon as possible after the sessions end, so if you can't make it to the conference you can still keep up to date. <br />

All of the blog posts will show up here on the ERES website and on my own Astronomy Blog, [Astrolady](http://sites.psu.edu/astrolady/blog/).<br />

Stay tuned for more updates. See you tomorrow!
