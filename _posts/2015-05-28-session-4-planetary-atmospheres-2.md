Aaaand...we're back! After our scintillating lunch discussion, we're back in the ballroom for our next wave of science talks. This is our second of two sessions on Planetary Atmospheres, chaired by Cornell University Research Associate Ramses Ramirez.

***The Pale Orange Dot: The Climactic and Spectral Effects of Haze in Archaen Earthâ€™s Atmosphere* (Giada Arney, University of Washington)**

Giada is from the University of Washington Astronomy and Astrobiology Program. While we want to know about the habitability of distant exoplanet, Earth will always be the best-studied habitable planet. So, we want to study the habitability of Earth throughout its history. She studies the Earth through the Archean period. During this period (~3.8-3.5 billion years ago), life first developed. We had a lot of methanotrophes (methane-eating bacteria), which were prolific because methane was much more abundant than oxygen in the atmosphere. We can look at Saturn's moon, Titan, to get a modern-day example of a methane-rich atmosphere. We think that the Archean Earth had an orange atmosphere with a methane haze, like Titan does. Since we think that the Earth at one point was hazy, this is a good phenomenon to study to understand potentially habitable worlds.

What would the climate be like on a hazy Earth-like world? As you increase the amount of methane in the atmosphere, you are increasing the methane haze. At around 30% methane the haze starts to cool the planet by shielding the sunlight, but at some point the cooling bottoms out. Conclusion: hazy worlds can be habitable. In the right conditions, it can work like a reverse greenhouse effect, cooling the planet to make it habitable.

How can we detect hazy atmospheres? Methane haze absorbs a lot of light in blue wavelengths, so objects that are missing portions of blue light in their reflection spectra are likely to be hazy. For transit transmission spectra, when you add haze into the atmosphere you can't see as deeply into the atmosphere, so your characteristic absorption features are more muted than normal. The spectrum at the ground of a hazy planet shows that the majority of the harmful UV light is blocked, so a hazy planet might have a greater chance at habitability, since the harmful types of light are reduced. As the haze on the early Earth was biologically produced and regulated, they might even be a signature of life.
