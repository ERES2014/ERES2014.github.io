This session is our "Alternate Career Panel," where we've invited three speakers who have all completed an astronomy PhD and then chosen to enter a career outside of a large, research-based academic environment. Our three speakers will be providing their perspectives on careers in a smaller academic environment, industry, and science policy. 

Note: as Kimberly is moderating this panel, your blog post for this session is written by Robert Morehead.

Our speakers are:

**Eric Jensen (EJ):** is a Professor of Astronomy at Swarthmore College. He holds a BA in Physics from Carleton College, and a PhD in Astronomy from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

**Josh Shiode (JS):** completed his PhD research at the University of California, Berkeley.
He is currently the Senior Government Relations Officer at the AAAS. Josh was also the John N. Bahcall Public Policy Fellow of the AAS.

**Dave Spiegel (DS):** received his PhD in Astronomy from Columbia University, and subsequently took postdocs at Princeton and at the Institute for Advanced Study. He now works as an R&D Data Scientist at Sum Labs.


<br />Q:Many people in the audience are probably considering between academic and non-academic career paths after they receive their PhDs. Can you talk about what your own thought process was as you went through the same consideration? What did you feel was most helpful to you in crystallizing your decision to pursue the career path that you choose? What did you wish you had known before you got on your current path?
