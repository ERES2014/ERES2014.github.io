Good morning everyone and welcome back to the ERES 2015 blog. Our first session this morning in on instrumentation related to exoplanet observations, and is chaired by Yale graduate student, Joseph Schmitt.

***The Habitable-zone Planet Finder Instrument: Pushing the Limits of Exoplanet Detection in the Near-Infrared* (Sam Halverson, PSU)**

The Habitable Zone Planet finder is am infrared doppler spectrograph with a 1 m/s precision to find habitable zone planets around M-dwarfs. The HPF team is a very large team spanning multiple universities, and multiple departments at PSU.

Why do we care about radial velocities in the near-infrared? The majority of nearby stars (from the RECONS) survey are M-dwarf stars, which primarily emit light in the NIR. There is a high frequency of planets around these M-dwarfs, almost half of them have at least one planet, and this is a population that is largely untapped by telescopes like *Kepler.* A habitable zone planet around one of these stars would induce an RV signal on the order of meters/second, so this instrument will be ideally placed to measure these RVs in the NIR.

The HPF will be mounted on the Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET) at McDonald Observatory, of which PSU is a partner. The HPF borrows some of the success of HARPS in its design. It is a fiber-fed spectrograph, with science fibers and calibration fibers. It uses a HgCdTe absorbing detector, not a CCD. The entire spectrograph is contained within a cryostat chamber, similar to the APOGEE instrument. To achieve 1 m/s precision in the NIR, they plan to utilize a laser-frequency comb, but are also looking into a Fabry-Perot etalon for a frequency calibrator, which may be of use to the wider astronomical community rather than tailor-made for the HPF observations. The HPF is exploring a new area of exoplanet detection, piggybacking on the successes of previous instruments like HARPS and APOGEE in its design, and developing cutting edge solutions to the complex problem of high-precision RVs in the NIR.
