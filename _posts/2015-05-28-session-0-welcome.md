Good morning everyone and welcome to ERES 2015 hosted here at PSU! My name is Kimberly Cartier and I will be your live-blogger for the duration of the conference.

Thanks to everyone who is tuning in both here and at the Twitter Feed [#ERES15](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ERES15&src=typd). We're beginning in only 15 short minutes and the ballroom is already filling up with excited (and sometimes sleepy) emerging researchers in exoplanet science, interesting posters, and slightly nervous organizing committee members. You live blogger is perched in the front row, ready to capture all of the amazing discoveries presented by our participants and comment on how the day is going. 

Our opening remarks will be starting in 15 minutes. Dr. Alex Wolszczan, the PSU astronomer who discovered the first exoplanets in 1992, will be introducing PSU Provost Dr. Nick Jones, who will be giving our opening remarks.
